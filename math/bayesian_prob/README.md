0x07-bayesian_prob
This directory contains work with Bayesian Probability:

You are conducting a study on a revolutionary cancer drug and are looking to find the probability that a patient who takes this drug will develop severe side effects. During your trials, n patients take the drug and x patients develop severe side effects. You can assume that x follows a binomial distribution.

Mandatory Tasks:
Likelihood
Write a function that calculates the likelihood of obtainin the data given various hypothetical probabilities of severe side effects from cancer drug study.
Intersection
Write a function that calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with various hypothetical probabilities.
Marginal Probability
Write a function that calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data.
Posterior
Write a function that calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data.
